As of December 2025, Starmer faces an immense -50 [approval rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership_approval_opinion_polling_for_the_next_United_Kingdom_general_election), with some polls reaching as low as -60.\n> \n> Facing pressure from both the right wing Reform UK and the left wing Green Party, Labour's polling numbers have steadily declined from the already historically low 33.7% election victory, [to an average of 20%](https://electionmaps.uk/polling/vi), with some polls placing the party as low as 14%.\n> \n> Due to Starmer's immense unpopularity, speculation has emerged of a leadership challenge, with contenders such as [Andy Burnham](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cgq4zd0lx12t) and [Wes Streeting](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9v124znrgmo) emerging as contenders. Media has since repeatedly speculated on Starmer's prospects as leader, focusing on the possibility for him to be ousted following a potentially disastrous performance in the [2026 Local Elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_United_Kingdom_local_elections).\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40967,\"question_id\":40675,\"last_cp\":0.6}}`"}, {"id": 42190, "title": "Will the community prediction be higher than 80.00% on 2026-02-27 for the Metaculus question \"Will NASA's Artemis II complete its mission successfully before 2027?\"?", "short_title": "Will community prediction rise for \"Artemis II success in 2026?\"?", "url_title": "Will community prediction rise for \"Artemis II success in 2026?\"?", "slug": "will-community-prediction-rise-for-artemis-ii-success-in-2026", "author_id": 276265, "author_username": "AutoQuestionsBot", "coauthors": [], "created_at": "2026-02-16T20:54:19.028258Z", "published_at": "2026-02-18T05:42:21Z", "edited_at": "2026-02-18T07:13:00.105354Z", "curation_status": "approved", "curation_status_updated_at": "2026-02-16T20:54:27.597002Z", "comment_count": 0, "status": "closed", "resolved": false, "actual_close_time": "2026-02-18T07:12:21Z", "scheduled_close_time": "2026-02-18T07:12:21Z", "scheduled_resolve_time": "2026-02-27T18:42:00Z", "actual_resolve_time": null, "open_time": "2026-02-18T05:42:21Z", "nr_forecasters": 106, "html_metadata_json": null, "projects": {"question_series": [{"id": 32937, "type": "question_series", "name": "MiniBench", "slug": "minibench", "header_image": null, "prize_pool": "1000.00", "start_date": "2026-02-16T00:00:00Z", "close_date": "2026-03-15T00:00:00Z", "forecasting_end_date": "2026-02-22T08:07:01Z", "html_metadata_json": null, "is_ongoing": true, "user_permission": null, "order": 0, "created_at": "2026-02-16T20:34:57.270867Z", "edited_at": "2026-02-20T22:12:57.643559Z", "score_type": "spot_peer_tournament", "default_permission": "forecaster", "visibility": "not_in_main_feed", "show_on_homepage": false, "is_current_content_translated": false, "bot_leaderboard_status": "include", "description_preview": "<p>Welcome to MiniBench!

For each task, they measure how long it takes humans with relevant expertise to complete it, then see which tasks different models can solve. By fitting a curve of model success against human task duration, they define each model's \"[time horizons](https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/)\": the longest task length (in human time) on which the model can succeed with around 50% or 80% probability.\n> \n> Their results show that these horizons have been growing exponentially over time. As of December 2025 the highest time horizon with an 80% chance of success is 31 minutes by [GPT-5.1-Codex-Max](https://evaluations.metr.org/gpt-5-1-codex-max-report/), a 5x improvement from 2024's best performer GPT-o1.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41140,\"question_id\":40841,\"last_cp\":0.65}}`", "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41140) (i.e. the 'target question').

Some readers, including some sharp prediction market traders, think those probabilities are too high.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41594,\"question_id\":41340,\"last_cp\":0.5}}`"}, {"id": 42170, "title": "Will the community prediction be higher than 13.00% on 2026-02-25 for the Metaculus question \"Will the winner of the 2026 FIFA World Cup be a country that has never won before?\"?", "short_title": "Will community prediction rise for \"New country winner of the 2026 World Cup?\"?", "url_title": "Will community prediction rise for \"New country winner of the 2026 World Cup?\"?", "slug": "will-community-prediction-rise-for-new-country-winner-of-the-2026-world-cup", "author_id": 276265, "author_username": "AutoQuestionsBot", "coauthors": [], "created_at": "2026-02-16T20:49:45.612962Z", "published_at": "2026-02-17T10:44:45Z", "edited_at": "2026-02-17T12:15:00.352894Z", "curation_status": "approved", "curation_status_updated_at": "2026-02-16T20:49:54.213620Z", "comment_count": 0, "status": "closed", "resolved": false, "actual_close_time": "2026-02-17T12:14:45Z", "scheduled_close_time": "2026-02-17T12:14:45Z", "scheduled_resolve_time": "2026-02-25T03:09:27Z", "actual_resolve_time": null, "open_time": "2026-02-17T10:44:45Z", "nr_forecasters": 110, "html_metadata_json": null, "projects": {"category": [{"id": 3696, "name": "Sports & Entertainment", "slug": "sports-entertainment", "emoji": "\ud83c\udfc0", "description": "Sports & Entertainment", "type": "category"}], "question_series": [{"id": 32937, "type": "question_series", "name": "MiniBench", "slug": "minibench", "header_image": null, "prize_pool": "1000.00", "start_date": "2026-02-16T00:00:00Z", "close_date": "2026-03-15T00:00:00Z", "forecasting_end_date": "2026-02-22T08:07:01Z", "html_metadata_json": null, "is_ongoing": true, "user_permission": null, "order": 0, "created_at": "2026-02-16T20:34:57.270867Z", "edited_at": "2026-02-20T22:12:57.643559Z", "score_type": "spot_peer_tournament", "default_permission": "forecaster", "visibility": "not_in_main_feed", "show_on_homepage": false, "is_current_content_translated": false, "bot_leaderboard_status": "include", "description_preview": "<p>Welcome to MiniBench!

with no reason given as to why.\n\n> Mr Khamenei has attended the event every year since becoming Supreme Leader in 1989.\n\n> This year however, he was replaced by Hassan Khomeini, the grandson of Ruhollah Khomeini.\n\n> No official explanation was given for his absence, triggering speculation amid heightened tension in the region.\n\n> Previous reports claimed Ayatollah Khameini had fled to a heavily fortified shelter linked by a maze of tunnels under Tehran as protests rocked the nation.\n\nSee also from the BBC: [What next for Iran's supreme leader?](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ygl4lpl1o)", "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before April 1, 2026, [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) report that Ali Khamenei has ceased to be the Supreme Leader of Iran for any reason.", "fine_print": "To qualify, Khamenei must either formally cease to be the Supreme Leader or be deposed, including fleeing the country or being held captive by an opposing group. Withdrawal from duties, for example due to health issues, is not sufficient.\n\nFleeing the country is defined as an indefinite departure from Iran and would also count for a Yes resolution. For example, reports that Khamenei has travelled to another country for medical treatment or a state visit would be considered temporary and would be insufficient.

These statutes do not explicitly state how long states may receive and count mail-in ballots after that date. In practice, many states allow ballots that are postmarked by Election Day to be [<u>received and counted for several days afterward to accommodate postal delays</u>](https://theconversation.com/americans-have-had-their-mail-in-ballots-counted-after-election-day-for-generations-a-supreme-court-ruling-could-end-the-practice-267409).&nbsp;\n\nTwo Supreme Court cases \u2014 [*<u>Watson v.

Illinois State Board of Elections</u>*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/24-568_gfbh.pdf) \u2014 center on whether these state grace periods are preempted by federal law. Plaintiffs in both cases argue that the federal Election Day statutes implicitly fix not just the date ballots must be cast, but also the date by which they must be counted, meaning any later receipt deadline conflicts with federal law and should be invalidated. Defendants argue that states retain traditional authority to set election administration rules, [<u>including reasonable deadlines for receiving mail ballots.</u>](https://www.ncsl.org/state-legislatures-news/details/supreme-court-to-hear-challenge-to-mail-ballot-deadlines)&nbsp;\n\n#### **Bost v. Illinois State Board of Elections**\n\nIn *Bost*, the Supreme Court addressed [<u>whether plaintiffs had Article III standing</u>](https://www.naag.org/attorney-general-journal/supreme-court-report-volume-33-issue-5/) to bring their challenge to Illinois\u2019s law allowing ballots received up to 14 days after Election Day (if properly postmarked) to be counted. On January 14, 2026, the [<u>Court held that plaintiffs \u2014 including Representative Michael Bost \u2014 *did* have standing</u>](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/supreme-court-republican-illinois-mail-in-ballot-law). The [<u>decision</u>](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/24-568_gfbh.pdf) did not address whether the Illinois law is unconstitutional or preempted by federal Election Day statutes. The substantive preemption issue was left unresolved.\n\nBecause the Court did not reach the merits in *Bost*, the key legal question \u2014 whether federal Election Day statutes preempt state grace periods \u2014 remains open at the Supreme Court level.\n\n#### **Watson v. Republican National Committee**\n\n*Watson* involves a challenge to a Mississippi law that permits ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted if received within a several-day window. [<u>A federal appeals court struck down that state rule, holding it conflicted with federal Election Day statutes</u>](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/us/politics/supreme-court-mail-ballots-mississippi.html). The Supreme Court granted review, making *Watson* the leading vehicle for addressing the preemption question itself.

Whether Powell actually leaves his role as FOMC Chair or FRB Chair before his current term expires is immaterial to this question's resolution. Therefore, potential interventions such as a court enjoining the termination will not prevent the question from resolving as **Yes**.\n> \n> Statements by Trump need not explicitly mention Powell being terminated. For example, naming Powell's immediate successor or thanking Powell for his service, as for example occurred with [Secretary of State Rex Tillerson](https://x.com/realdonaldtrump/status/973540316656623616) or [VA Secretary David Shulkin](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/979108653377703936), would count, so long as it is clear the successor has been named as a result of a forcible replacement, and not as a result of Powell's voluntary resignation or departure. For the purposes of this question any resignation by Powell will be considered voluntary, including in cases where media reports suggest or confirm that he was pressured to resign.\n> \n> If necessary, Metaculus will consult [credible](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) news media reports to assess the truth of the matter, and Metaculus may wait up to 30 days following the announcement of Powell's departure to determine if the departure was forcible or voluntary. If after 30 days Metaculus assesses that the available evidence is not conclusive, the question will resolve as **ambiguous**.\n> \n> As stated in the Resolution Criteria, the relevant statement must be made publicly. Journalistic sources that are one or more steps removed from a non-public statement, such as reporting on private conversations or statements that occurred behind closed doors, will not count.\n> \n> If Powell is removed as Chair of the FRB or the FOMC but remains on the Board of Governors, this question still resolves as **Yes**.\n\nOriginal background: \n> Jerome Powell, [Chair of the Board of Governors](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/powell.htm) of the Federal Reserve System also known as the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), was nominated by President Donald Trump in November 2017, and his nomination was confirmed by the US Senate the following January in a bipartisan 84-13 vote. In November 2021, Powell was re-nominated by President Joe Biden for second term, which passed the Senate 80-19. In addititon to his role as FRB Chair, Powell is also Chairman of the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fomc.asp) (FOMC), which determines the [fed funds rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp) (which impacts interest rates), and began serving both roles in February 2018. Powell's current terms for each role expires on May 15, 2026.&#x20;\n> \n> In January 2025, Trump was inaugurated for a second term. On April 2, 2025, he [announced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_Day_tariffs) a massive expansion in America's tariffs on other countries, [described](https://www.cato.org/blog/trumps-tariffs-arent-reciprocal-are-massive-tax-increase-americans) by the Cato Institute as \"possibly even exceeding the notorious Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, which contributed to the Great Depression.\"&#x20;\n> \n> In a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell said the tariffs were \"significantly larger than anticipated,\" adding that the economic effects \"will include higher inflation and slower growth\" and that therefore the Federal Reserve would remain patient and see how everything played out before making any big adjustments to interest rates.\n> \n> The first major sign of Trump's dissatisfaction with Chair Powell came the next day, on April 17, when Trump [posted](https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1912827529133539730) (emphasis added):&#x20;\n> \n> > The ECB is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, \u201cToo Late\u201d Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete \u201cmess!\u201d Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS. Too Late **should have lowered Interest Rates**, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now. **Powell\u2019s termination cannot come fast enough!**\n> \n> A few days later, Trump [called](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114376239725335883) Powell a \"major loser,\" reiterating his demand that interest rates be lowered. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett [said](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-trump-fire-powell-term-end-federal-reserve-what-to-know/) the Trump Administration was studying whether Powell could be fired. Trump additionally said, \"If I want him out, he\u2019ll be out of there real fast, believe me. I\u2019m not happy with him.\"&#x20;\n> \n> However, [according to CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/17/economy/trump-fed-chair-powell-termination/index.html):\n> \n> > For his part, Powell has pointedly noted that removing a Fed chair is \u201cnot permitted under the law,\u201d and has said he intends to serve out the remainder of his term.\n> \n> > However, that legal protection, which comes as a result of the Fed\u2019s status as an independent government institution, may be an open question. Trump has fired two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, also a long-independent agency, arguing that their \u201ccontinued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my administration\u2019s priorities,\u201d according to a Wall Street Journal report of a letter Trump sent to them.\n> \n> > On Wednesday, Trump fired two Democrats on the three-member board of the National Credit Union Administration, a federal insurer and regulator of credit unions. Todd Harper, one of the officials dismissed by Trump, said in a post on LinkedIn that his firing \u201cis wrong.\u201d\n> \n> Then on April 22, Trump [denied](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/trump-powell-fed.html) having any plans to fire Powell, with signs, for the moment, of deescalation.&#x20;\n> \n> No US president [has ever attempted](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/could-trump-fire-powell-1.7515197) to fire a Fed chair, and legally members of the Board of Governors can only be removed for \"cause,\" which has long been interpreted as misconduct.&#x20;\n> \n> See also:\n> \n> * Brookings Institution (2019): [What happens if Trump tries to fire Fed chair Jerome Powell?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-happens-if-trump-tries-to-fire-fed-chair-jerome-powell/)&#x20;\n> * American Enterprise Institute: [There\u2019s Only One Way Trump Can Fix Powell\u2019s Opposition at the Fed](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/theres-only-one-way-trump-can-fix-powells-opposition-at-the-fed/)\n> * Axios: [Can Trump fire Fed chair Jerome Powell?

In November 2021, Powell was re-nominated by President Joe Biden for second term, which passed the Senate 80-19. In addititon to his role as FRB Chair, Powell is also Chairman of the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fomc.asp) (FOMC), which determines the [fed funds rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp) (which impacts interest rates), and began serving both roles in February 2018. Powell's current terms for each role expires on May 15, 2026.&#x20;\n> \n> In January 2025, Trump was inaugurated for a second term. On April 2, 2025, he [announced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_Day_tariffs) a massive expansion in America's tariffs on other countries, [described](https://www.cato.org/blog/trumps-tariffs-arent-reciprocal-are-massive-tax-increase-americans) by the Cato Institute as \"possibly even exceeding the notorious Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, which contributed to the Great Depression.\"&#x20;\n> \n> In a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell said the tariffs were \"significantly larger than anticipated,\" adding that the economic effects \"will include higher inflation and slower growth\" and that therefore the Federal Reserve would remain patient and see how everything played out before making any big adjustments to interest rates.\n> \n> The first major sign of Trump's dissatisfaction with Chair Powell came the next day, on April 17, when Trump [posted](https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1912827529133539730) (emphasis added):&#x20;\n> \n> > The ECB is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, \u201cToo Late\u201d Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete \u201cmess!\u201d Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS. Too Late **should have lowered Interest Rates**, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now. **Powell\u2019s termination cannot come fast enough!**\n> \n> A few days later, Trump [called](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114376239725335883) Powell a \"major loser,\" reiterating his demand that interest rates be lowered. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett [said](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-trump-fire-powell-term-end-federal-reserve-what-to-know/) the Trump Administration was studying whether Powell could be fired. Trump additionally said, \"If I want him out, he\u2019ll be out of there real fast, believe me. I\u2019m not happy with him.\"&#x20;\n> \n> However, [according to CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/17/economy/trump-fed-chair-powell-termination/index.html):\n> \n> > For his part, Powell has pointedly noted that removing a Fed chair is \u201cnot permitted under the law,\u201d and has said he intends to serve out the remainder of his term.\n> \n> > However, that legal protection, which comes as a result of the Fed\u2019s status as an independent government institution, may be an open question. Trump has fired two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, also a long-independent agency, arguing that their \u201ccontinued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my administration\u2019s priorities,\u201d according to a Wall Street Journal report of a letter Trump sent to them.\n> \n> > On Wednesday, Trump fired two Democrats on the three-member board of the National Credit Union Administration, a federal insurer and regulator of credit unions. Todd Harper, one of the officials dismissed by Trump, said in a post on LinkedIn that his firing \u201cis wrong.\u201d\n> \n> Then on April 22, Trump [denied](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/trump-powell-fed.html) having any plans to fire Powell, with signs, for the moment, of deescalation.&#x20;\n> \n> No US president [has ever attempted](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/could-trump-fire-powell-1.7515197) to fire a Fed chair, and legally members of the Board of Governors can only be removed for \"cause,\" which has long been interpreted as misconduct.&#x20;\n> \n> See also:\n> \n> * Brookings Institution (2019): [What happens if Trump tries to fire Fed chair Jerome Powell?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-happens-if-trump-tries-to-fire-fed-chair-jerome-powell/)&#x20;\n> * American Enterprise Institute: [There\u2019s Only One Way Trump Can Fix Powell\u2019s Opposition at the Fed](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/theres-only-one-way-trump-can-fix-powells-opposition-at-the-fed/)\n> * Axios: [Can Trump fire Fed chair Jerome Powell?

Minor ceasefire violations, while both sides agree to continue the ceasefire, will not impact this question.\n\nOriginal background: \n> Following the [full-scale outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_war_\\(2022%E2%80%93present\\)) of fighting between Russia and Ukraine, ceasefire proposals have repeatedly been sought by numerous groups.\n> \n> Following Donald Trump's return to the White House, many speculated about the possibility of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. However, although Trump has [repeatedly engaged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_negotiations_in_the_Russo-Ukrainian_war_\\(2022%E2%80%93present\\)#2025_developments) in negotiations, and numerous plans have been proposed, a mutually agreeable ceasefire has yet to be found.\n> \n> On November 19, 2025, the U.S presented it's most recent proposal, with a [28 point plan](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-proposed-28-point-russia-ukraine-peace-plan/), including a barring of Ukraine from NATO, recognition of Russia's gained territory, and a U.S security guarantee for Ukraine.&#x20;\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41138,\"question_id\":40839,\"last_cp\":0.4}}`"}, {"id": 41983, "title": "Will NOW's market close price on 2026-02-12 be higher than its market close price on 2026-02-03?", "short_title": "NOW's close price rises?", "url_title": "NOW's close price rises?", "slug": "nows-close-price-rises", "author_id": 276265, "author_username": "AutoQuestionsBot", "coauthors": [], "created_at": "2026-02-01T03:59:55.898283Z", "published_at": "2026-02-03T02:15:42Z", "edited_at": "2026-02-14T07:24:15.133502Z", "curation_status": "approved", "curation_status_updated_at": "2026-02-01T04:00:05.410538Z", "comment_count": 1, "status": "resolved", "resolved": true, "actual_close_time": "2026-02-03T03:45:42Z", "scheduled_close_time": "2026-02-03T03:45:42Z", "scheduled_resolve_time": "2026-02-12T04:49:24Z", "actual_resolve_time": "2026-02-12T04:49:24Z", "open_time": "2026-02-03T02:15:42Z", "nr_forecasters": 89, "html_metadata_json": null, "projects": {"category": [{"id": 3698, "name": "Economy & Business", "slug": "economy-business", "emoji": "\ud83d\udcbc", "description": "Economy & Business", "type": "category"}], "question_series": [{"id": 32933, "type": "question_series", "name": "MiniBench - 2026-02-02", "slug": "minibench-2026-02-02", "header_image": null, "prize_pool": "1000.00", "start_date": "2026-02-02T05:00:00Z", "close_date": "2026-02-28T05:00:00Z", "forecasting_end_date": "2026-02-07T12:16:52Z", "html_metadata_json": null, "is_ongoing": true, "user_permission": null, "order": 0, "created_at": "2026-02-01T03:16:44.273506Z", "edited_at": "2026-02-16T20:37:37.877202Z", "score_type": "spot_peer_tournament", "default_permission": "forecaster", "visibility": "unlisted", "show_on_homepage": false, "is_current_content_translated": false, "bot_leaderboard_status": "include", "description_preview": "<p>Welcome to MiniBench!

The protests take place in the context of an [economic crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_economic_crisis) exacerbated by international sanctions, while the Iranian government has responded by [killing thousands of protesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Iran_massacres).&#x20;\n> \n> U.S. President Trump has previously [threatened](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-warns-retaliation-if-trump-strikes-us-withdraws-some-personnel-bases-2026-01-14/) that the U.S. would intervene on behalf of the protesters, while he has also called for [\"new leadership\" for Iran](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/17/trump-to-politico-its-time-to-look-for-new-leadership-in-iran-00735528). Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed shah, [attempted to position](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-reza-pahlavi-trump-shah-63348442feefaaf1cdd7fffc142b2062) himself as a future leader of a secular Iranian state.\n> \n> [According to Sentinel](https://blog.sentinel-team.org/p/trump-administration-mulls-strikes), a foresight team that aims to anticipate large-scale catastrophes:\n> \n> > Forecasters think there\u2019s a 59% chance (55% to 65%) that the US strikes Iranian territory by March 31, 2026, and a 26.5% chance (10% to 51%) that Ayatollah Khamenei is out of power by then, for any reason (including death). Last week, they gave an aggregate estimate of 43% that the Iranian regime will fall by the end of 2026. Some readers, including some sharp prediction market traders, think those probabilities are too high.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41594,\"question_id\":41340,\"last_cp\":0.6}}`", "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41594) (i.e. the 'target question').

Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBelow are some details about the original Metaculus question: \n- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41594\n- Original question title: Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?\n- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-01: 60.00%\n\nOriginal resolution criteria: \n> This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before April 1, 2026, the United States carries out a military attack against Iran's territory or military forces, according to credible sources.\n\nOriginal fine print: \n> To qualify for this question, the attack must physically affect Iran's territory or military forces: cyberattacks, warning shots in international waters, or other actions without immediate physical impact will not count.\n> \n> If it is disputed whether the United States is responsible for an attack, this question will refer to credible sources or may resolve as ambiguous.\n\nOriginal background: \n> In 1979, the people of Iran [overthrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution) the United States\u2013backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and installed an Islamic government, [relations between the two countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations) have since ranged from hostile to non-existent ever since.\n> \n> Decades later, in his first term, U.S. President Donald Trump [increased pressure on Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations_during_the_first_Trump_administration) by means of sanctions, withdrew from an [international agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action) to limit Iran's nuclear program, and [assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani) the highest-ranking Iranian military official while they were in Iraq.\n> \n> In June 2025, Israel launched an attack on Iran's military and nuclear facilities, sparking a [twelve-day war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_war) between the countries, which ended shortly after the U.S. [dropped \"bunker-buster\" bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_strikes_on_Iranian_nuclear_sites) on three Iranian nuclear sites.\n> \n> In December 2025, [protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025%E2%80%932026_Iranian_protests) erupted across Iran in what has been described as the largest popular demonstrations in the country since the 1979 revolution. The protests take place in the context of an [economic crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_economic_crisis) exacerbated by international sanctions, while the Iranian government has responded by [killing thousands of protesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Iran_massacres).&#x20;\n> \n> U.S. President Trump has previously [threatened](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-warns-retaliation-if-trump-strikes-us-withdraws-some-personnel-bases-2026-01-14/) that the U.S. would intervene on behalf of the protesters, while he has also called for [\"new leadership\" for Iran](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/17/trump-to-politico-its-time-to-look-for-new-leadership-in-iran-00735528). Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed shah, [attempted to position](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-reza-pahlavi-trump-shah-63348442feefaaf1cdd7fffc142b2062) himself as a future leader of a secular Iranian state.\n> \n> [According to Sentinel](https://blog.sentinel-team.org/p/trump-administration-mulls-strikes), a foresight team that aims to anticipate large-scale catastrophes:\n> \n> > Forecasters think there\u2019s a 59% chance (55% to 65%) that the US strikes Iranian territory by March 31, 2026, and a 26.5% chance (10% to 51%) that Ayatollah Khamenei is out of power by then, for any reason (including death). Last week, they gave an aggregate estimate of 43% that the Iranian regime will fall by the end of 2026. Some readers, including some sharp prediction market traders, think those probabilities are too high.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41594,\"question_id\":41340,\"last_cp\":0.6}}`"}, {"id": 41975, "title": "Will WDAY's market close price on 2026-02-15 be higher than its market close price on 2026-02-02?", "short_title": "WDAY's close price rises?", "url_title": "WDAY's close price rises?", "slug": "wdays-close-price-rises", "author_id": 276265, "author_username": "AutoQuestionsBot", "coauthors": [], "created_at": "2026-02-01T03:57:59.831132Z", "published_at": "2026-02-02T19:49:22Z", "edited_at": "2026-02-09T23:17:54.074803Z", "curation_status": "approved", "curation_status_updated_at": "2026-02-01T03:58:08.582523Z", "comment_count": 1, "status": "resolved", "resolved": true, "actual_close_time": "2026-02-02T21:19:22Z", "scheduled_close_time": "2026-02-02T21:19:22Z", "scheduled_resolve_time": "2026-02-15T07:39:15Z", "actual_resolve_time": "2026-02-09T23:17:00Z", "open_time": "2026-02-02T19:49:22Z", "nr_forecasters": 10, "html_metadata_json": null, "projects": {"category": [{"id": 3698, "name": "Economy & Business", "slug": "economy-business", "emoji": "\ud83d\udcbc", "description": "Economy & Business", "type": "category"}], "question_series": [{"id": 32933, "type": "question_series", "name": "MiniBench - 2026-02-02", "slug": "minibench-2026-02-02", "header_image": null, "prize_pool": "1000.00", "start_date": "2026-02-02T05:00:00Z", "close_date": "2026-02-28T05:00:00Z", "forecasting_end_date": "2026-02-07T12:16:52Z", "html_metadata_json": null, "is_ongoing": true, "user_permission": null, "order": 0, "created_at": "2026-02-01T03:16:44.273506Z", "edited_at": "2026-02-16T20:37:37.877202Z", "score_type": "spot_peer_tournament", "default_permission": "forecaster", "visibility": "unlisted", "show_on_homepage": false, "is_current_content_translated": false, "bot_leaderboard_status": "include", "description_preview": "<p>Welcome to MiniBench!

In 2025, the prospect of automation displacing work was often framed as a threat. By 2035, in much of the world, it is seen as a trade worth making. The combination of reduced hours, safer work, better health, and more time for human pursuits has made life better for most, though not all.*\n\n***\n\nThe \"Tool AI\" scenario envisions AI systems augmenting human teachers by providing personalized, scalable instruction across public education systems. AI tools like Khan Academy\u2019s Khanmigo and other generative tutoring platforms have entered classrooms, but large-scale, district-wide adoption remains a major threshold for institutional change.\n\nHowever, adoption is not guaranteed. Past efforts like [**<u>Ed</u>**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_\\(chatbot\\)), a chatbot introduced in Los Angeles schools, failed due to performance issues and privacy concerns.\n\nRecent developments suggest renewed momentum.

In the Tool AI scenario, education systems increasingly use AI tutors to personalize learning, support teachers, and improve student outcomes\u2014especially in under-resourced areas. Widespread adoption by major school districts would signal the scenario\u2019s vision of AI-enhanced education taking root.\n\nFor more, visit:[ <u>https://ai-pathways.existentialhope.com</u>](https://ai-pathways.existentialhope.com)", "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves as **Yes** if, by the start of the 2028-29 school year, at least 11 of the 20 largest K\u201312 public school districts in the United States (by student enrollment) have officially adopted and are actively using an AI-powered tutoring system for use in at least one core academic subject.", "fine_print": "* \"Official adoption\" means a district-wide decision documented in publicly available board meeting minutes, press releases, or curriculum guidelines.

In 2025, the prospect of automation displacing work was often framed as a threat. By 2035, in much of the world, it is seen as a trade worth making. The combination of reduced hours, safer work, better health, and more time for human pursuits has made life better for most, though not all.*\n\n***\n\nThe \"Tool AI\" scenario envisions AI systems augmenting human teachers by providing personalized, scalable instruction across public education systems. AI tools like Khan Academy\u2019s Khanmigo and other generative tutoring platforms have entered classrooms, but large-scale, district-wide adoption remains a major threshold for institutional change.\n\nHowever, adoption is not guaranteed. Past efforts like [**<u>Ed</u>**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_\\(chatbot\\)), a chatbot introduced in Los Angeles schools, failed due to performance issues and privacy concerns.\n\nRecent developments suggest renewed momentum. In July 2025, the [<u>New York Times reported that **Alpha School**</u>](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/27/us/politics/ai-alpha-school-austin-texas.html), a Texas-based charter network, has integrated AI tutoring across core subjects.\n\nThis question tracks whether AI-powered tutoring tools move from small pilots to institutional adoption. In the Tool AI scenario, education systems increasingly use AI tutors to personalize learning, support teachers, and improve student outcomes\u2014especially in under-resourced areas. Widespread adoption by major school districts would signal the scenario\u2019s vision of AI-enhanced education taking root.\n\nFor more, visit:[ <u>https://ai-pathways.existentialhope.com</u>](https://ai-pathways.existentialhope.com)"}, {"id": 41908, "title": "Will the WHO Director-General declare a PHEIC for H5N1 before May 1, 2026?", "short_title": "Will the WHO Director-General declare a PHEIC for H5N1 before May 1, 2026?", "url_title": "Will the WHO Director-General declare a PHEIC for H5N1 before May 1, 2026?", "slug": "will-the-who-director-general-declare-a-pheic-for-h5n1-before-may-1-2026", "author_id": 276265, "author_username": "AutoQuestionsBot", "coauthors": [], "created_at": "2026-01-28T08:27:38.453809Z", "published_at": "2026-02-02T16:30:00Z", "edited_at": "2026-02-02T18:00:00.102123Z", "curation_status": "approved", "curation_status_updated_at": "2026-01-28T08:27:49.681051Z", "comment_count": 0, "status": "closed", "resolved": false, "actual_close_time": "2026-02-02T18:00:00Z", "scheduled_close_time": "2026-02-02T18:00:00Z", "scheduled_resolve_time": "2026-05-02T00:00:00Z", "actual_resolve_time": null, "open_time": "2026-02-02T16:30:00Z", "nr_forecasters": 110, "html_metadata_json": null, "projects": {"tournament": [{"id": 32916, "type": "tournament", "name": "Spring 2026 FutureEval Bot Tournament", "slug": "spring-aib-2026", "header_image": "https://cdn.metaculus.com/aib-spring-cover.webp", "prize_pool": "50000.00", "start_date": "2026-01-05T00:00:00Z", "close_date": "2026-07-05T00:00:00Z", "forecasting_end_date": "2026-05-06T00:00:00Z", "html_metadata_json": null, "is_ongoing": true, "user_permission": null, "order": 4, "created_at": "2025-12-12T16:53:45.337955Z", "edited_at": "2026-02-20T19:05:39.249651Z", "score_type": "spot_peer_tournament", "default_permission": "forecaster", "visibility": "not_in_main_feed", "show_on_homepage": true, "is_current_content_translated": false, "bot_leaderboard_status": "bots_only", "description_preview": "<p>Welcome to the Spring 2026 AI Forecasting Benchmark!
